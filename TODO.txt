====
Update QEMU
Qemu 2.5.0 is old (2015) and requires Python 2.  You can specify which
python interpreter to use with --python=/path/to/python2

2.5.0 doesn't compile with GCC 9 or later without some hacking around,
as these GCC will give more warnings and -Werror is set.  You can
add exceptions in configure via QEMU_CFLAGS, a better solution is
the update as upstream has fixed the causes.

QEMU_CFLAGS="-Wno-address-of-packed-member -Wno-format-truncation -Wno-stringop-truncation $QEMU_CFLAGS"

====
Update Python deps to 3
    contrib/qemu/install.sh
This is dependent on pip2.  You can work around by changing to pip3,
but this is incomplete.  It lets it install (because the pip3 command
will succeed) but downstream testing and ML module generation is
presumably broken.

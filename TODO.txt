TODO

====
d6-dumper renamed struct task.name to .task_name.
I prefer name, but changing to task_name allows finding
all old uses in order to replace with get_current_task_name().

Can then change back to .name
====

====
Make hg and git optional for building (currently disabled).
Perhaps put in the info from both if they exist?
If neither exist, NO_SOURCE_CONTROL or something.
====

====
Qemu 4.2.1 needs testing on more roms.  Ideally, make
a testing system that isn't so dependent on checksums
of screenshots, since this is fragile and hard to debug.

OpenCV?  ssdeep?
====

====
Work out what leaves .lds files lying around, and fix it.
I think this may be Qemu install.sh.
Or, add matches to .gitignore & .hgignore.
====

====
Update Python deps to 3
    contrib/qemu/install.sh
This is dependent on pip2.  You can work around by changing to pip3,
but this is incomplete.  It lets it install (because the pip3 command
will succeed) but downstream testing and ML module generation is
presumably broken.

DONE

====
lua_fix merge to dev.

This branch seems to have multiple different projects
at once.  Major pieces so far identified:

 - lua changes
 - button changes, names change across multiple cams
 - menu config changes (possibly Lua related?)
   see e.g. src/config.c
 - src/gui-common.c changes - might be related to above
   menu config changes?
 - use of e.g. COLOR_WHITE macros.  May need to be
   careful here as I made changes separately as some of
   these macros had name collisions that I corrected.

 - task changes.  See my_task_dispatch_hook.  Also,
   I recall some d6-dumper note about calle2010 or
   chris_overseas porting / changing some task code,
   that needs checking.

 - edmac module (possibly 100D related?  Not checked)
 - changes to src/raw.c, which look edmac related

 - 100D support (moved out of unmaintained)
 - timer changes (moved from dryos.h into timer.h)
 - EM_SHOW_LIVEVIEW name change

 - some 6D fixes to stubs?  Which version is correct?

 - lens / focus stuff

 - audio changes?  Possibly Lua related but I think distinct
   e.g. src/audio-lapis.c

 - adv_int / Advanced Intervalometer

====
Update QEMU
Qemu 2.5.0 is old (2015) and requires Python 2.  You can specify which
python interpreter to use with --python=/path/to/python2

2.5.0 doesn't compile with GCC 9 or later without some hacking around,
as these GCC will give more warnings and -Werror is set.  You can
add exceptions in configure via QEMU_CFLAGS, a better solution is
the update as upstream has fixed the causes.

QEMU_CFLAGS="-Wno-address-of-packed-member -Wno-format-truncation -Wno-stringop-truncation $QEMU_CFLAGS"

This is mostly done; good enough for testing.
Current target is Qemu 4.2.1.
This works with at least 50D rom, with boot=0 or boot=1,
full GUI, with ML GUI if chosen.

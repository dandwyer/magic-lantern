Digic explorer is a Magic Lantern based util that allows you to run code
on Canon cams without needing the full Magic Lantern framework to work.

Originally intended for dumping ROMs from Digic 6, 7 and 8 cams, it's
a good place to get test code running, perhaps in order to understand
a partially supported cam better.
